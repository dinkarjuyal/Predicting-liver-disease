## Project: Predicting Liver Disease from data


**Problem Statement**
Given a dataset containing various attributes of 583 Indian patients, define a classification algorithm which can identify whether a person is suffering from liver disease or not.

**Solution Statement**
To solve this problem, I will be using one or more classification algorithms covered in the udacity MLND. I will be trying out Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, knearest neighbours and one ensemble method.
Different combinations of hyperparameters for individual algorithms , like kernel, degree and C for SVM and weights, n_neighbours and algorithms for k-Nearest Neighbours will be tried across the training sets. Depending on their respective performances on the
cross-validation sets, the best algorithm with appropriate hyperparameter tuning will be finalised as the solution.
